        My name is Maya, and I’m a second-year student at Ontario Tech
        University, majoring in Networking and IT Security. I'm passionate about
        technology, <br />
        particularly troubleshooting and fixing technical issues, and I aim to
        pursue a career in this field. In my free time, I enjoy reading,
        watching anime, and <br />
        building Legos or miniature houses. I also have experience in 3D design
        using Blender, along with intermediate skills in Python and HTML/CSS
        coding.

      <p><b>My Skills</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>Blender (3D):</b> I have intermediate experience in Blender, I have created multiple
        3D models and projects. I’ve worked on projects thar involve
        modeling, texturing, lighting, and rendering. My work in Blender has
        helped me develop a strong eye for detail and creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>HTML & CSS:</b> I’m proficient in HTML and CSS, I know how to
        structure web pages using HTML and style them with CSS to create
        responsive and visually appealing designs. This knowledge supports my
        interest in IT and networking, especially when it comes to creating user
        interfaces or dashboards for managing data.</p> 
        <p>
        <b>Python:</b> I have intermediate skills in Python, with a decent understanding of its syntax, 
        data structures, and object-oriented programming principles. I’ve used Python to develop
        applications, including a student ledger management database where I
        created a user-friendly interface for administrators to manage student
        records. This project demonstrates my ability to build practical,
        database-driven applications. 
    </p> 
    <p>
        <b>CLI (Command Line Interface):</b> I’m
        comfortable using the Command Line Interface (CLI) to execute commands, and interact with systems. 
        CLI skills are essential for IT and networking, especially when managing servers, configuring
        networks, or troubleshooting issues.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Subnetting:</b>
        I have a deep understanding of IPv4 subnetting, including how to
        calculate subnet addresses, broadcast addresses, subnet masks, and host
        counts. This skill is crucial for optimizing network performance and
        security, especially when working with large or complex networks.
